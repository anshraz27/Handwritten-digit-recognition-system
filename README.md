## Introduction

This project aims to build a machine learning model capable of recognizing handwritten digits (0-9) from images. The MNIST dataset is used for training and evaluating the model. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.

## Features

- Preprocessing of image data
- Training of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Evaluation of model performance
- Prediction on new handwritten digit images

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/handwritten-digit-recognition.git
    cd handwritten-digit-recognition
    ```

2. **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Follow these steps to use the handwritten digit recognition system:

1. **Prepare the data:**
    Download the MNIST dataset if not already available. The dataset will be automatically downloaded when running the script.

2. **Train the model:**
    ```bash
    python train_model.py
    ```

3. **Evaluate the model:**
    ```bash
    python evaluate_model.py
    ```

4. **Predict on new images:**
    ```bash
    python predict.py --image_path path_to_image
    ```

## Dataset

The MNIST dataset is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. It includes 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

## Model

The project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for recognizing handwritten digits. The model architecture includes multiple convolutional layers, activation layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.

## Results

The trained model achieves an accuracy of approximately 99% on the MNIST test dataset. Detailed performance metrics and confusion matrix can be found in the `results` directory.
